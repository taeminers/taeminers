### 👋 Hi there! 
My name is Taemin Lee, but you can just call me Kyle.

I'm a Product-Minded Engineer based in South Korea.

I thrive at the intersection of technical execution and strategic product vision. My passion is building robust, scalable platforms and ensuring strong ideas move from concept to execution. 

I prioritize the development of market-driven solutions that deliver clear business value over engineering purely technical endeavors.

My Focus Areas:

💻 Frontend Development: Love building UI that moves people. Also have basic backend knowledge.

💡 Product & Strategy: Bridging the gap between stakeholder needs and technical implementation (Product Owner experience in Legal-tech).

🚀 Entrepreneurship: Driven by continuous growth and challenge. Co-founded a personalized news platform during my studies.

Always looking for high-rigor environments and complex technical challenges! Let's build something great. 🤝

Func Facts: 
* I love coffee AND tea
* I rarely get mad (really!)
* Pizza is my favorite food (by far)
* Hobbies: anime, gym
