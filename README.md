### 👋 Hi there! 
My name is Taemin Lee, but you can just call me Kyle.

I'm a Product-Minded Engineer based in South Korea.

I thrive at the intersection of technical execution and strategic product vision. My passion is building robust, scalable platforms and ensuring strong ideas move from concept to execution. 

I prioritize the development of market-driven solutions that deliver clear business value over engineering purely technical endeavors.

Always looking for high-rigor environments and complex technical challenges! Let's build something great. 🤝
